### Introduction/Project Overview:

This is a python and SQL project on an imaginary supermarket called FAX STORE.
This analysis project aims to analyse the sales the FAX Store made over the 1st half of the year 2024. From this data analysis, we want to identify the trend of sales, make data-driven recommendations, gain a deeper understanding of FAX store’s performance, and make critical decisions regarding the progress of the organization.

### Data Source:

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “fax.csv” file. It contains detailed information about each sale made by the store in the 1st half of 2024.

### Tools:

-	Excel
-	Python Data Analysis (Spyder)

### Data Cleaning/Preparation:

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

EDA provides the means to exploring the sales data to answer critical questions such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales period?
- What could account for the peak sales period of certain items?
